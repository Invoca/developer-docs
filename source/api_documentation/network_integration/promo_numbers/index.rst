Promo Numbers
=============

Advertiser Campaign and Affiliate Campaign Promo Numbers
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The API provides the ability to manage promo numbers for a given campaign.
Promo numbers are uniquely identified by the phone number itself and these numbers are always generated by the Invoca platform.
Therefore, the operations on the promo numbers interface are not idempotent.
When you POST a promo number, we return the promo_number in the response body. This capability is JSON‐only.

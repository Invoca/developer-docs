Conversion Reporting Pixel
==========================

A conversion pixel is placed on an advertiser's web page to report a conversion event that triggers payouts on the platform.  Typically, the pixel is placed on a shopping cart confirmation page or lead form thank you page.

For "Publisher Promotion" or Fixed Price "Bundled" Campaigns, the Advertiser_ID is listed on the Campaign Summary, Integration panel.

For all other campaign types, the Advertiser_ID is accessible from the ﻿Advertiser Home Page. ﻿Note the address b in the ar  the browswer in t he rD follows /as/ in the URL.

The ﻿Sales_Params ﻿available are documented in Conversion Reporting API under the "Shared Parameters for Sales and Web Conversions" section.

The advertiser campaign and publisher are determined based on what link drove the traffic to the advertiser's site, and are calculated automatically.

We support tying a web pixel to a subsequent server-side conversion. In order to tie the conversions together, you must have passed a reference_id to the original web pixel, and also pass that same reference_id to the Conversion Reporting API.

<h3>
Example URLs
</h3>
---
(assuming that Advertiser_ID = 1)
Most basic URL, just reports that a conversion occurred, but without a sale or any additional data:

  `http://api.invoca.net/pixels/conversion/1.gif`

Report a conversion where a $10 sale occurred:

  `http://api.invoca.net/pixels/conversion/1.gif?sale_amount=10`

Report a conversion with specific sales data:

  `http://api.invoca.net/pixels/conversion/1.gif?sale_amount=10&reason_code=renewal&sku_list[]=34657`

Report a conversion with multiple sku items:

  `http://api.invoca.net/pixels/conversion/1.gif?sale_amount=10&sku_list[]=dog&sku_list[]=cat`

Report a conversion with unique identifier to track later (in the Transactions API or future pixel-based conversions):

  `http://api.invoca.net/pixels/conversion/1.gif?sale_amount=0&reason_code=new_signup&reference_id=2012994455`

Update a conversion that was reported earlier:

  `http://api.invoca.net/pixels/conversion/1.gif?sale_amount=95.0&reason_code=confirmed_order&parent_reference_id=2012994455`
